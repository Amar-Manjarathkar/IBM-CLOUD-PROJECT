🚀 Projects


This repository contains two main projects:

1. Travel Buddy: An Agentic AI Planner
This project is an "Agentic AI" built using IBM watsonx.ai. The agent, "Travel Buddy," uses a knowledge base (Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG) to help users plan trips, suggest destinations, and answer travel-related questions.

Key Files:

Travel Buddy.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the agent's code.

Travel Planner Agent.pdf: The official project report and description.

travel_kb_100_destinations.json / .pdf: The knowledge base files that provide the agent with its travel information.

travel_planner_training_questions.pdf: Sample questions used to train or test the RAG agent.

Test Input for Travel Planner Agent.json: A sample JSON file for testing the agent's input.

Travel Planner Agent_test_result.json: Sample JSON output from the agent.

2. Fault Data Prediction (Random Forest)
This is a classical machine learning project to predict faults. It uses a Random Forest Classifier, likely built and deployed using IBM watsonx.ai's AutoAI or Snap ML capabilities.

Key Files:

_P5 - Snap Random Forest Classifier_10-Min-ML-Project.ipynb: The main notebook for building and training the Random Forest model.

Fault_data_1.ipynb: (Possibly an earlier version or related notebook).

FAULT_DATA.py: A Python script, likely for data preprocessing or helper functions.

First Deployment_test.json: Sample JSON data for testing the deployed model's API.

First Deployment_test_result.json: The prediction results received from the deployed model.
